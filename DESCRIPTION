Version: 0.1.0
Author: Inga Patarcic
Maintainer: The package maintainer <inga.patarcic@gmail.com>
Description:This package is used to analyze personal genotype which is obtained
by using one of the direct-to-consumer (DTC) DNA tests from DNA testing
companies such as myHeritage, 23andMe, ancestryDNA, etc.
Currently, user can import genotypes, overlap personal genotypes with 
SNP-triat database results (such as GWASCatalog) or a list od SNP unique
identifiers and corresponding risk alleles, identify risk alleles,
expand SNP list by identifying SNPs that are in LD with reported SNPs.
